Thanks for installing Fox!


How to activate
===============

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (âŒ˜+, on Mac).

Fox comes in different flavors, based on Base16 color schemes. You can choose whichever flavor you like, but don't forget to change *both* color scheme and UI theme so they match.

*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.*
